# Hello everyone!

This is the page to share my cv or resume, and link some of the works of me.
I am currently the Ph. D. student, in Dept. of Information Display, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, S.Korea.
I am studying about the optical engineering, especially the holographic recording system.

Here's my resume (ver. Jan, 2019): [link](https://github.com/kihongChoi/kihongChoi.github.io/blob/master/cv_ver20190122.pdf)

## Project
### DIY holographic camera ([project page on Github](https://github.com/kihongChoi/gpsidh))
* The genuine holographic camera under the incoherent illuminations
* Simple structure, easy to DIY.
* currently coined as "Geometric phase Self-interference incoherent digital holography (GP-SIDH)"
