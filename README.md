# Hello everyone!

This is the page to share my cv or resume, and link some of the works of me.
I am currently the Ph. D. student, in Dept. of Information Display, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, S.Korea.
I am studying about the optical engineering, especially the holographic recording system.

Here's my resume (ver. Jul, 2018): [link](kihongChoi.github.io/resume_khchoi_20180702ver.pdf)
